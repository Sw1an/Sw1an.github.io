Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) easy machines which called `Sar` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:

- Getting Shell:

The port `80` is running `sar2HTML` application:
![shell](../../assets/img/sample/pg-sar/rce.png)


## Privilege Escalation:
- Running [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum):
![linenum](../../assets/img/sample/pg-sar/linenum.png)

- Exploiting cronjob and getting root on the box:
![cron](../../assets/img/sample/pg-sar/cron.png)

- Reverse Shell:

I used [this script](https://github.com/bing0o/Reverse_Shell_Generator) to generate Reverse Shell and running a netcat listener:
![root](../../assets/img/sample/pg-sar/root.png)

Happy Hacking!
